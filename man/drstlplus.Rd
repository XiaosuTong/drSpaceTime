\title{D&R Seasonal Trend Decomposition of Time Series by Loess}
\usage{
drstlplus(input, output, model_control = spacetime.control(),
  cluster_control = mapredcue.control(), ...)
}
\description{
Decompose a time series into seasonal, trend and irregular components using \code{loess}, acronym STL. A new implementation of STL. Allows for NA values, local quadratic smoothing, post-trend smoothing, and endpoint blending. The usage is very similar to that of R's built-in \code{stl()}.
}
\note{
This is a complete re-implementation of the STL algorithm, with the loess part in C and the rest in R. Moving a lot of the code to R makes it easier to experiment with the method at a very minimal speed cost. Recoding in C instead of using R's built-in loess results in better performance, especially for larger series.
