\title{Readin Raw text data files and save it as by time division on HDFS.}
\usage{
readIn(input, output, info, cluster_control = mapreduce.control(),
  cshift = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{The path of input file on HDFS. It should be raw text file.}

\item{output}{The path of output file on HDFS. It is by time division.}

\item{info}{The RData on HDFS which contains all station metadata. Make sure
copy the RData of station_info.RData, which is also available in the drSpaceTime
package, to HDFS first using rhput.}

\item{cluster_control}{all parameters that are needed for mapreduce job}
}
\description{
Input raw text data file is download from NCDC, and is available in the
drSpaceTime package in ./inst/extdata. It is read in and divided into by-month
division saved on HDFS
}
